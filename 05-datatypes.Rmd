Data structures 
---------------

+ **Atomic vectors** are arrays that contain a single data type (logical, real, complex, character). 
Each of the following is a one-dimensional atomic vector: 

```{r}
passed <- c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
class(passed)
ages <- c(15, 18, 25, 14, 19, 21)
class(ages)
namez <- c("Bob", "Ted", "Carol", "Alice") # names is R function!
class(namez)  
```

A scalar is an atomic vector with a single element. 
So `k <- 2` is a shortcut for `k <- c(2)`.

+ A **matrix** is an atomic vector that has a dimension attribute, `dim()`, containing two elements (`nrow`, number of rows and `ncol`, number of columns) 

```{r}
matrix(ages, nrow = 2)
```

+ **Lists** are collections of atomic vectors and/or other lists.

```{r}
mylist <- list(passed, ages, namez)
mylist
```

We can assign names to list objects:
```{r}
names(mylist) <- c("passed", "ages", "namez")
mylist

```


+ **Data frames** are a special type of list, where each atomic vector in the collection has the same length. 
Each vector represents a column (variable) in the data frame.

```{r}
exam <- data.frame(name = namez, passed = passed)
exam
```

### Vectors

The combine function `c()` is used to form the vector.

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 5, -3, 6, -2, 4)
b <- c("one", "two", "three")
d <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) # We use d instead of c as vector name. Why?
```


`a` is a numeric vector, `b` is a character vector, and `d` is a logical vector. 
The data in a vector can be only one type (numeric, character, or logical).

You can refer to elements of a vector: 

```{r}
a[c(2, 4)] # Refers to the second and fourth elements of vector a.
'['(a, c(2,4)) # [ is a function! This is very handy in case of piping, as we see in the upcoming lessons.
```

We can sort/order vector:

```{r}
sort(a, decreasing = FALSE) # sorts vector in ascending order
```

We can extract uniqe elements of a vector:

```{r}
d
unique(d) # Returns a vector, data frame or array like d but with duplicate elements removed.
```

Create sequence:

```{r}
seq(2, 5, by = 0.5)
```

A complex sequence:

```{r}
rep(1:4, times = 2)
```

Repeat each element of a vector: 

```{r}
rep(1:2, each = 3)
```

Repeat elements of a vector:

```{r}
rep(c("poodle","sheltie"), each = 3, times = 2)
```

### Matrix

Matrix: a collection of vectors, which are all numeric, character, or logical. 

```{r}
n <- matrix(rnorm(30), ncol = 5) 
dim(n)
```

```{r}
n
```


```{r}
exam # we created previously data.frame exam
class(exam)
m <- as.matrix(exam) # coerce data.frame with n,m dimension to a matrix with n,m dimension 
m
t(m) # transposes a matrix
```

Transpose a data frame with 1st column as factor

```{r}
n <- exam$name
df <- as.data.frame(t(exam[,-1]))
colnames(df) <- n
df
```

### Data frame

* `data frame`: a collection of vectors where different columns can contain different modes of data (numeric, character, and so on). 
Each vector contains only 1 mode of data (`vector1 <- c("a", 2, 3.4)` is automatically coerced to `chr`, but can be manually coerced to numeric or factor). 
The data frame columns are variables, and the rows are observations. 
Vectors are bound into matrix/data.frame vertically, with the direction from top to bottom. 
Column = vector.
`as.matrix()` has default argument `byrow = FALSE`, change this to fill matrix by rows.

* `tibble::data_frame()` is a more modern version of data.frame (slight differences for the better)
`as.data_frame()` converts to it. 
`data_frame()` does less than `data.frame()`: 
    + it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!), 
    + it never changes the names of variables, and it never creates `row.names()`.

**Tibbles** have a print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. 
This makes it much easier to work with large data. 
In addition to its name, each column reports its type. 
Tibbles clearly delineate `[` and `[[`: `[` always returns another tibble, `[[` always returns a vector. 
Some older functions don't work with tibbles because they expect `df[, 1]` to return a vector, not a data frame. 
If you encounter one of these functions, use `as.data.frame()` to coerce a tibble back to a data frame:

![Iris dataset contains sepal and petal measurements of three iris species.](http://articles.concreteinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/irises.png)

```{r}
library(dplyr) # tbl_df 
tbl_df(iris)
```
```{r}
class(as.data.frame(tbl_df(iris)))
```

```{r}
height <- c(187, 190, 156)
name <- c("Jim", "Joe", "Jill")
my_tab <- data.frame(name, height)
my_tab
```

A vector can be extracted by `$` and worked on:

```{r}
Mean.height <- mean(my_tab$height)
Mean.height # Prints the answer
```

New vectors can be bound into a data.frame:

```{r}
my_tab$weight <- c(87, 96, 69) # Now there are 3 columns in my_tab
my_tab
```


```{r}
my_tab$experiment <- factor("A") # the 4th col contains a factor with a single level "A"
levels(my_tab$experiment) # prints the unique levels in a factor vector
```

```{r}
head(iris) # Prints first 6 rows; tail(df) last 6
```

```{r}
summary(iris) # Prints a summary of data
```

```{r}
names(iris) # Prints column names
```

```{r}
nrow(iris) # number of rows
```

### Contingency table
Contingency table is a type of table in a matrix format that displays the frequency distribution of the variables.

We use Rio 2016 summer Olympics medal table to illustrate contingency table.
First we download and munge medals table from Wikipedia page.
```{r}
library(rvest)
rio <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics_medal_table") # download wikipedia web page containing Rio Olympics medals table
tab_node <- html_nodes(rio, 'table[class="wikitable sortable plainrowheaders"]') # extract html node from webpage containing medals table
medals <- html_table(tab_node, fill=TRUE) # extracts table as data.frame from html, outputs list
medals <- medals[[1]] # we have list of length 1, we extract data.frame and assign it back to medals  
medals <- medals[-nrow(medals),-1] # Identify last row number and remove this last row 'Total' and first column 'Rank'
```

![Rio 2016 medals feature images of Nike, the Panathinaiko Stadium and the Acropolis (Photo: Rio 2016/Alex Ferro)](https://smsprio2016-a.akamaihd.net/news/Nj2RO1/4pUVV_IM.jpg)

Lets see the top rows of our medals table, using function `head()`:
```{r}
head(medals)
```

How many contries have won certain number of medals?
First, we use function `table()` to display already summed up data from Total column.
```{r}
table(medals$Total, dnn = c("Medals")) # how many countries have shown number of medals
```

Second, we use `xtabs()` and `ftable()` functions to summarise all colors of medals and display summed up data.
```{r}
ftable(xtabs(Gold + Silver + Bronze ~ NOC, data = medals), dnn = c("Medals"))
```

#### Confusion matrix
`table()` can be useful to display classification model performance as confusion matrix (although `caret` library has special function `confusionMatrix()`). 

We use `iris` dataset to train k-nearest neighbours model to predict Species based on sepal and petal measurements.

```{r}
library(caret)
model <- knn3(Species~., data = iris) # here we perform KNN classification of iris dataset
predicted <- predict(model, iris[,-ncol(iris)], type = "class") # predict Species based on model
table(iris$Species, predicted) # how good is our model?
```

`table()` outputs contingency table in **wide format**. To illustrate this point, we use **Tartu Maraton 2013** cross-country skiing marathon 63 km distance finish data. Elukoht -- country, Vanuseklass -- age group.
```{r}
load("data/Tartu_Maraton_2013.RData")
head(sort(table(tm_2013$Elukoht), decreasing = TRUE)) # most frequent country/county
table(tm_2013$Vanuseklass)
```
![[Tartu Maraton](https://www.tartumaraton.ee/en/about/). Photo: Kaimo Puniste](https://www.tartumaraton.ee/et/klubist/ajalugu/raamat/FotoKaimoPuniste.jpg)

We can display number of participants per **country** and **age group** in a **wide format**
```{r}
head(table(tm_2013$Elukoht, tm_2013$Vanuseklass))
```

In contrast, `dplyr` function `count` outputs results in **long format**:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
count(tm_2013, Elukoht, Vanuseklass, sort = TRUE) # outputs a tibble
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
count(medals, Gold, Silver, Bronze, sort = TRUE)
```
### List
A list is an ordered collection of objects. 
Basically, in R you can shove any data structure into list.
E.g. list may contain a combination of vectors, matrices, data frames, and even other lists, (poodles?). 
You can specify elements of the list by: 

```{r}
mylist[[2]]
mylist[["ages"]]
mylist$ages
```

As you can see all these above expressions give identical result 
```{r}
all.equal(mylist[[2]], mylist[["ages"]], mylist$ages)
```

Output of statistical tests in R is usually a list. 
Here we perform t test to compare `Petal.length` of two iris species `setosa` and `virginica from iris dataset. 
```{r}
unique(iris$Species) # three species in a dataset
iris_subset <- filter(iris, Species!='versicolor') # we filter out '!=' versicolor data
a <- t.test(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris_subset) # a is a list of 9
str(a) # str() displays the internal structure of an R object
a$conf.int # extracts an element from the list
a$p.value # p.value
```
