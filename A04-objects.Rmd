# R objects

An R object is anything that can be assigned a value (data, functions, graphs, analytic results, and more). 
Every object has a class attribute telling R how to handle it. 
Common R data structures are: vectors (numerical, character, logical), matrices, data frames, and lists.
The basic data structure in R is the vector.

### Class of object
An R vector is characterized by a mode that describes its contents: logical, numeric, complex, character.

An R data structure is characterized by a class that describes its structure: matrix, array, factor, time-series, data frame, and list.

To determine the class of your object use `class(object)` - prints the class attribute of an object.

```{r}
myobject <- list(1,"a")
class(myobject) # gives the data structure of object 'myobject'
```

### R expressions
Syntactically correct R expressions (`y <- x * 10`) will be referred to as statements.
R uses the symbol `<-` for assignments, rather than the typical `=` sign.

Here we create a vector named `x` containing five random numbers from a standard normal distribution.
```{r}
x <- rnorm(5)
x
y <- x * 10 # here we multiply numeric vector x by 10
y
```

### Assigning value to object

`a` is an object containing character "b": 
```{r}
a <- "b"
a
```

You can overwrite objects (assign a new value to it):
```{r}
a <- c("poodle","sheltie") # c(1,2) is a vector 
a # a now contains two values: "poodle" and "sheltie"
```

You can copy objects under new name: 
```{r}
b <- a
b
```

You can use output of `function 1` as input to `function 2`:
```{r}
foo <- function(x) x^4 # function 1
foo(x = 2)
d <- sqrt(foo(2)) # function 'sqrt' calculates square root
d
```

> Never use a function name as object name -- `c` vs. `c()`. You rewrite that function in your environment and you get into trouble!

### Coercing

```{r}
a <- "42"
a
class(a)

b <- as.numeric(a)
b
class(b)

b <- as.factor(a)
b
class(b)
```


To coerce the factor `ss` with two levels `10` and `20` into numbers you must convert it to character first: 
```{r}
ss <- as.factor(c(10,20))
ss
# lets see what happens if we try to convert ss directly to numeric
as.numeric(ss)

as.numeric(as.character(ss))
```

Factor variables are encoded as integers in their underlying representation. So a variable like "poodle" and "sheltie" will be encoded as 1 and 2 in the underlying representation [more about factors and stringsAsFactors option when importing a data.frame](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/07/24/stringsasfactors-an-unauthorized-biography/).

Factors are used to group data by their levels for analysis (e.g. linear model: `lm()`) & graphing. 
In earlier versions of R, storing character data as a factor was more space efficient if there is even a small proportion of repeats. However, identical character strings now share storage, so the difference is small in most cases. 
Nominal variables are categorical, without an implied order. 

```{r}
diabetes <- c("Type1", "Type2", "Type1", "Type1") # diabetes is a factor with 2 levels
diabetes # a character vector
class(diabetes)

diabetes <- factor(diabetes) # coerce to factor
diabetes # factors
class(diabetes)
```

Encoding `diabetes` vector as a factor stores this vector as `r as.numeric(diabetes)` and associates it with 1 = Type1 and 2 = Type2 internally (the assignment is alphabetical).
Any analyses performed on the vector diabetes will treat the variable as nominal and select the statistical methods appropriate for this level of measurement.    


Ordinal variables imply order but not amount. 
`Status (poor, improved, excellent)`. 
For vectors representing ordinal variables, add `ordered = TRUE` to the `factor()` function. 

```{r}
status <- c("Poor", "Improved", "Excellent", "Poor")
status
```

For ordered factors, override the alphabetic default by specifying levels. 

```{r}
status <- factor(status, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("Poor", "Improved", "Excellent")) # Assigns the levels as 1 = Poor, 2 = Improved, 3 = Excellent. 
status
```

Continuous variables have order & amount (`class: numeric or integer`). 
Numeric variables can be re-coded as factors. 
If sex was coded as 1 for male and 2 for female in the original data, 

```{r}
sex <- sample(c(1,2), 21, replace = TRUE) # lets generate data
sex
```

then, `factor()` converts the variable to an unordered factor.    
The order of the labels must match the order of the levels. 
Sex would be treated as categorical, the labels "Male" and "Female" would appear in the output instead of 1 and 2

```{r}
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Male", "Female"))
sex
```
