Getting and installing R
---------------

### To start:

1. Download and install **R** from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Download and install **RStudio** from [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/)

3. Open RStudio
4. Select `Project` menu from the **upper right corner** and either create `New Project` or `Open Project`

```{r setwdex, include = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Sets working directory, into which things are saved by default and from which stuff is imported
setwd("/Users/ulomaivali/Dropbox/") # mac
setwd("C:/Users/ulomaivali/Dropbox/") # windows
setwd("~/Dropbox/R course/") # linux, ~/ references to user home directory
```


Where are we?
```{r getwd}
# Prints the current working directory
getwd()
```

### Getting help

You can get help from R Documentation at the program's command prompt by preceding R command with ?.

```{r help}
?getwd()
```


In RStudio if you type the name of the function without parentheses eg. `scale` and hit the `F1` key, the help page of the function is shown in the lower right panel.

### Tips and tricks

+ `Cmd + Enter` (`Ctrl + Enter` on a PC) in RStudio: sends the current line (or current selection) from the editor to the console and runs it. 
+ `Alt + -` in RStudio: gives assignment operator `<-`. 
+ `Ctrl + Shift + M` in RStudio: gives piping operator `%>%`. 
+ `Ctrl + Shift + C` in RStudio: comment/uncomment lines.

+ R is case-sensitive. 
+ Enter commands one at a time at the console or run a set of commands from the editor. 
+ Object names and column names cannot begin with a number. 
+ No spaces in object names! (use `.` or `_` or `-`).
