# Reports with rmarkdown
R markdown is a variant of markdown that has embedded R code chunks. R markdown allows you to combine your R code, producing statistics and plots, with write-up. With the help of knitr and pandoc R markdown documents can be converted into reports in html, pdf or MS word format.

**This is how basic rmarkdown document template looks like in RStudio:**
<pre><code>---
title: "Untitled"
output: html_document
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.</code></pre>

To knit this rmarkdown document into a html, pdf or word document hit `Knit` button in the head of source file window in RStudio:

## Chunk Options

Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the `{}` of a chunk header. Some of the frequently used chunk options:

+ `include = FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
+ `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
+ `message = FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
+ `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
+ `fig.cap = "..."` adds a figure caption.
