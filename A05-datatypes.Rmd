# Data structures 

+ **Atomic vectors** are arrays that contain a single data type (logical, real, complex, character). 
Each of the following is a one-dimensional atomic vector: 

```{r}
passed <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) # random sequence
class(passed)
ages <- c(53, 51, 25, 67, 66, 41, 62, 42) # random numbers
class(ages)
namez <- c("Marina", "Allar", "Siim", "Mart", "Mailis", "Eiki", "Urmas") # random names, names is R function!
class(namez)  
```

A scalar is an atomic vector with a single element. 
So `k <- 2` is a shortcut for `k <- c(2)`.

+ A **matrix** is an atomic vector that has a dimension attribute, `dim()`, containing two elements (`nrow`, number of rows and `ncol`, number of columns) 

```{r}
matrix(ages, nrow = 2)
```

+ **Lists** are collections of atomic vectors and/or other lists.

```{r}
mylist <- list(passed, ages, namez)
mylist
```

We can assign names to list objects:
```{r}
names(mylist) <- c("passed", "ages", "namez")
mylist

```

+ **Data frames** are a special type of list, where each atomic vector in the collection has the same length. 
Each vector represents a column (variable) in the data frame.

```{r}
exam <- data.frame(name = namez, passed = passed)
exam
```

# Selecting by index
Index gives the address that specifies the elements of vector/matrix/list or data.frame, which are then automatically selected.

+ Indexing begins at 1 (not 0) in R
+ Indexing operators in R are square brackets -- '[', `[[` and dollar sign `$`  
+ `[` allows selecting more than one element, whereas `[[` and `$` select only one element.
+ Empty index [,] means "select all" -- `a[,1]` means "select all rows and 1st column from `a`".

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- '['(c(1,2,3), 1) == c(1,2,3)[1] # as you can see these are both identical -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- + you can select values, rows or columns by index -->

<!-- + `-` (minus) before index means "not this element" -->
<!-- + ! means "not" -->
<!-- + != means "not equal" -->
<!-- + == means "equal" -->

During initial data exploration it is often necessary to have a look how the head of your table looks like, for this you can use convenience methods `head` and `tail` which are returning first and last elements of a object, respectively:
```{r}
head(mtcars) # Prints first 6 elements (rows) as default
tail(mtcars, n = 3) # Prints last 3 elements (rows)
```

Tip: you can use `tail` to return the very last element of a object with unknown length.

```{r}
tail(LETTERS, n = 1)
```

# Vectors

The combine function `c()` is used to form the vector.

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 5, -3, 6, -2, 4)
b <- c("one", "two", "three")
d <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) # We use d instead of c as vector name. Why?
```

`a` is a numeric vector, `b` is a character vector, and `d` is a logical vector. 
The data in a vector can be only one type (numeric, character, or logical).

You can refer to elements of a vector: 

```{r}
a[c(2, 4)] # Refers to the second and fourth elements of vector a.
'['(a, c(2,4)) # [ is a function! This is very handy in case of piping, as we see in the upcoming lessons.
```

We can sort/order vector:

```{r}
sort(a, decreasing = FALSE) # sorts vector in ascending order
```

We can extract uniqe elements of a vector:

```{r}
d
unique(d) # Returns a vector, data frame or array like d but with duplicate elements removed.
```

Create sequence:

```{r}
seq(2, 5, by = 0.5)
```

A complex sequence:

```{r}
rep(1:4, times = 2)
```

Repeat each element of a vector: 

```{r}
rep(1:2, each = 3)
```

Repeat elements of a vector:

```{r}
rep(c("poodle","sheltie"), each = 3, times = 2)
```


# Data frame

* `data frame`: a collection of vectors where different columns can contain different modes of data (numeric, character, and so on). 
Each vector contains only 1 mode of data (`vector1 <- c("a", 2, 3.4)` is automatically coerced to `chr`, but can be manually coerced to numeric or factor). 
The data frame columns are variables, and the rows are observations. 
Vectors are bound into matrix/data.frame vertically, with the direction from top to bottom. 
Column = vector.
`as.matrix()` has default argument `byrow = FALSE`, change this to fill matrix by rows.

* `tibble::data_frame()` is a more modern version of data.frame (slight differences for the better)
`as_data_frame()` converts to it. 
`data_frame()` does less than `data.frame()`: 
    + it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!), 
    + it never changes the names of variables, and it never creates `row.names()`.

**Tibbles** have a print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. 
This makes it much easier to work with large data. 
<!-- In addition to its name, each column reports its type.  -->
<!-- Tibbles clearly delineate `[` and `[[`: `[` always returns another tibble, `[[` always returns a vector.  -->
<!-- Some older functions don't work with tibbles because they expect `df[, 1]` to return a vector, not a data frame.  -->
<!-- If you encounter one of these functions, use `as.data.frame()` to coerce a tibble back to a data frame: -->

![Iris dataset contains sepal and petal measurements of three iris species.](http://articles.concreteinteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/irises.png)

```{r}
library(dplyr) # tbl_df 
tbl_df(iris)
```
```{r}
class(as.data.frame(tbl_df(iris)))
```

```{r}
library(tibble)
height <- c(187, 190, 156)
name <- c("Jim", "Joe", "Jill")
my_tab <- data_frame(name, height) # object names are used as column names
my_tab
```


```{r}
summary(my_tab) # Prints a summary of data
```

```{r}
names(my_tab) # Prints column names
```

```{r}
nrow(my_tab) # number of rows
ncol(my_tab)
dim(my_tab)
```

## Indexing data.frames
<!-- Data frames can be indexed in several modes. When [ and [[ are used with a single vector index (x[i] or x[[i]]), they index the data frame as if it were a list. -->

We use R `mtcars` dataset to illustrate indexing of a data.frame:
```{r}
class(mtcars)
dim(mtcars) # what's the size of the data.frame
mtc <- mtcars[sample(1:nrow(mtcars), 6), ] # select a manageable subset
mtc
```

Here we select columns: 
```{r}
mtc[,2] # selects 2nd column and returns vector
mtc[3] # selects 3nd column and returns data.frame
mtc[, "hp"] # selects column named "hp"
mtc$cyl # selects column named "cyl"
```


```{r}
df <- data.frame(M = c(2, 3, 6, 3, 34), N = c(34, 3, 8, 3, 3), L = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
df
df[df$M == 34,] # selects rows from A that have value == 34
```

```{r}
df[1:2, "N"] # selects rows 1 through 2 from column "A"
```

```{r}
rownames(df) <- letters[1:5] # letters vector gives us lower case letters
df[rownames(df) == "c",] # selects row named "c"
```

```{r}
df[-(2:4),] # drops rows 2 to 4 (incl)
```

```{r}
df[, -2] # drops col 2, outputs vector! 
```

```{r}
df[df$M == 6,] # selects all rows that contain 6 in column named M
```

```{r}
df[df$M != 6,] # selects all rows that do not contain 6 in column named M
```

```{r}
df[df$L==T,] # selects all rows where L is TRUE (T)
```

What if we have duplicated rows or elements in our data frame or vector (and we want to get rid of them)?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?duplicated #  determines which elements of a vector or data frame are duplicates of elements with smaller subscripts
```

```{r}
df[!duplicated(df),] # removes second one of the duplicated rows from df, we have to use ! to negate logical evaluation
```

```{r}
df[df$M > median(df$N) & df$M < 25,] # selects rows where df$M value is > median df$N AND df$M value < 25
```


```{r}
df[df$M > median(df$N) | df$M == 34,] # selects rows where df$M value is > median df$N OR df$M value == 34
```

```{r}
sum(df$M[df$L==T]) # sums column df$M at rows where column 'L' is TRUE (T)
```

A vector can be extracted by `$` and worked on:

```{r}
Mean.height <- mean(my_tab$height)
Mean.height # Prints the answer
```

New vectors can be bound into a data.frame:
```{r}
my_tab$weight <- c(87, 96, 69) # Now there are 3 columns in my_tab
my_tab
```


```{r}
my_tab$experiment <- factor("A") # the 4th col contains a factor with a single level "A"
levels(my_tab$experiment) # prints the unique levels in a factor vector
```


# Matrix
Matrix: a collection of data elements, which are all numeric, character, or logical.

Why use matrix? The choice between matrix and data.frame comes up only if you have data of the same type.

+ The answer depends on what you are going to do with the data in data.frame/matrix. 
If it is going to be passed to other functions then the expected type of the arguments of these functions determine the choice.

+ Matrices are more memory efficient:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2)
d <- as.data.frame(m)
object.size(m)
object.size(d)
```

+ Matrices are a necessity if you plan to do any linear algebra-type of operations.
+ Data frames are more convenient if you frequently refer to its columns by name (via the `$` operator).
+ Data frames are also better for reporting tabular data as you can apply formatting to each column separately.

```{r}
n <- matrix(rnorm(30), ncol = 5) 
dim(n)
```

```{r}
n
```


```{r}
exam # we created previously data.frame exam
class(exam)
m <- as.matrix(exam) # coerce data.frame with n,m dimension to a matrix with n,m dimension 
m
t(m) # transposes a matrix
```

<!-- Transpose a data frame with 1st column as factor -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- n <- exam$name -->
<!-- df <- as.data.frame(t(exam[,-1])) -->
<!-- colnames(df) <- n -->
<!-- df -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Indexing matrices -->
<!-- Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute and so all the vector forms of indexing can be used with a single index.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- m <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, dimnames = list(c("a","b","d"), LETTERS[1:4])) -->
<!-- m -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- m[1,]                 # the first row of matrix m -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- m[1, , drop = FALSE]  # is a 1-row matrix -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- m[, c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)] # logical indexing -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- m[cbind(c(1,2,1), 3:1)] # matrix numeric index -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ci <- cbind(c("a", "b", "a"), c("A", "C", "B")) -->
<!-- m[ci]                 # matrix character index -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- m[,-1]           # delete the first column of m -->
<!-- ``` -->

# List
A list is an ordered collection of objects. 
Basically, in R you can shove any data structure into list.
E.g. list may contain a combination of vectors, matrices, data frames, and even other lists, (poodles?). 
You can specify elements of the list by: 

```{r}
mylist[[2]]
mylist[["ages"]]
mylist$ages
```

As you can see all these above expressions give identical result 
```{r}
all.equal(mylist[[2]], mylist[["ages"]], mylist$ages)
```

## Indexing lists
Indexing by `[` is similar to atomic vectors and selects a list of the specified element(s).
Both `[[` and `$` select a single element of the list (e.g. a single vector or data frame).

```{r}
mylist # here we go back to our mylist object
```

```{r}
mylist[[1]]               # the first element of list mylist
```

```{r}
mylist[c(1, 3)]           # a list containing elements 1 and 3 of mylist
```

```{r}
mylist$ages               # the element of mylist named ages
```

Difference between using `[` and `[[` for subsetting a list:
```{r}
mylist[1]
class(mylist[1]) # returns list with one object
mylist[c(1,2)]
class(mylist[c(1,2)]) # returns list with two objects
```

```{r}
class(mylist[[1]]) # returns list object as vector in this case
```

If we use double square brackets `[[` with index vector e.g. c(3,2) we get 2nd element from 3rd list object:
```{r}
mylist[[c(3,2)]]
```


<!-- ### Recursive indexing into lists -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- z <- list(a = list(x = 9, y = "chello"), b = 1:5) # we create list named 'a' inside list 'z' -->
<!-- z -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- unlist(z) # look what happens if we simplify this list into vector... -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- z$a$x # what's a$x in list z -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- z[[c(1, 2)]] # we get second element of 1st element of list z -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- z[[c("a", "x")]] <- "piano" # here we replace z$a$x with "piano" -->
<!-- z -->
<!-- ``` -->

Query names of list objects:
```{r}
names(mylist)
```

Set/change names of list objects:
```{r}
names(mylist) <- c("a","b","c")
names(mylist)
```

New name for nth list object:
```{r}
names(mylist)[2] <- c("poodles")
names(mylist)
```


## Output from statistical tests
Output of statistical tests in R is usually a list. 
Here we perform t test to compare two vectors a and b. 
```{r}
a <- rnorm(10) # random normal vector with mean 0
b <- rnorm(10,2) # random normal vector with mean 2
t.result <- t.test(a, b) # t test
str(t.result) # str() displays the internal structure of an R object
t.result$conf.int # extracts an element from the list
t.result$p.value # p.value
```
