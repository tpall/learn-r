# Introduction

R is [functional programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [statistical environment](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).
R, together with rmarkdown and Git/github has rich and growing ecosystem that enables reproducible data carpentry and statistical analysis and dissemination of nicely formatted analysis results.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
# Load saved CRAN package data to environment
rpkg <- readRDS("data/Available_CRAN_Packages.rds")
rpkg_n <- group_by(rpkg, Date) %>% summarise(Packages = n())
cap <- sprintf("The number of available CRAN packages grows exponentially, featuring %s available packages as of %s.", length(unique(rpkg$Package)), rpkg$Date[1])
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.show='asis', fig.align='center', fig.cap=cap}
ggplot(rpkg_n, aes(ymd(Date), cumsum(Packages), group = 1)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Number of packages") + 
  xlab("Years") + 
  ggtitle("Available CRAN Packages")
```


**R pros**    

- Just about any type of data analysis can be done in R. 
- R contains advanced statistical routines not yet available in other packages.  
- R provides reproducibility in data analysis, and yet is very flexible (everyone can write their parallel solution to any problem). 
- R has the most comprehensive feature set available to visualize complex data. 
- The results of any analytic step can easily be saved, manipulated, and used as input for additional analyses. 
- R can import/export data from text files, pdf-s, database-management systems, statistical packages, and specialized data stores. 
- R can also access data directly from web pages, social media sites, and a wide range of online data services.  
- R provides a natural language for quickly programming recently published methods.  
- Most operations in R are much quicker than manipulating tables in MS Excel or LO Calc. 
- R has a large community of users -- most questions can be quickly answered by googling.  
- For a non-programmer R is easier to learn than Python, etc. (Ülo: most users do not program in R, and don't need to.)  

A key reason that R is a good thing is because it is a language. The power of language is abstraction. The way to make abstractions in R is to write functions [(Burns, 2011)](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf).

**R cons** (none is the deal breaker):    

- With R you must know exactly, what you want to do – in terms of your immediate atomic goals in data massage, methods of statistical analysis, and the overall strategy of analysis. 
- It is **like getting your own keys to daddy's F-16 fighter plane**. Get a setting wrong **and boom!**
- R has uneven inbuilt help – but a lot of users who are willing to help you.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Unlike your daddy's F-16, it's similarly annoying but safe to crash your R session. Image: [The Brofessional](http://www.thebrofessional.net/guy-builds-incredible-working-replica-dutch-f-16-military-fighter-jet-scratch/)"}

```

**Alternatives**    

You can prepend "Some say, .." to these statements:

- MS Excel might be better for inputting data into tables.
- Graphpad Prism is much more foolproof and easier to use as a statistical tool (but has limited functionality). There is a free web version of Graphpad – [check it out](http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/).  
- Python is more widely spread as a general purpose programming language -- it is also arguably better in working with external databases (which we won't).
