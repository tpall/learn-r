# ggplot2 -- grammar of graphics
**ggplot2** is an R package for producing statistical graphics based on the grammar of graphics (hence the gg!).

Main features of ggplot2:
+ ggplot2 has plots with presets like drawing legends and high data-ink ratio. 
+ ggplot2 works iteratively -- you can start with a layer showing the raw data and then add layers of annotations and statistical summaries.

To compose a plots, you have to supply minimally:

+ **Data** that you want to visualise and **aes**thetic mappings -- what's on x-axis, what's on y-axis, and how to you want to group and color your data.
+ **Layers** made up of **geom**etric elements: points, lines, boxes, etc. 

You can further adjust your plot:

+ using **scale**s to redraw a legend or axes.
+ using **facet**ing to break up the data into subsets for display.
+ using **theme**s which control plot features like the font size 
  and background colour.
